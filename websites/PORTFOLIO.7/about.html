        <p>Why Do I Want To Become Squad Leader?</p>

        <p>Since i started studing in Goal Oriented Academy i noticed positive influence squad leaders can have on students even i can say from my experience that my squad leader (DATO THE GOAT) inspired me to work harder.</p>

        <p>I know that being a squad leader is hard and i see that as a challenge that can be surpassed.</p>

        <p>As a squad leader i will help those students who just like me are beginners in programming and i will be able to share that positive impact which i got since i joined this academy. From this i think i will even motivate my friends to join academy since till now they are still hesitant and not sure about joining GOA!</p>

        <p>A few reasons why i want to become squad leader:<br>
           1. I love programming<br>
           2. I could go further in my programming career<br>
           3. I will help students who are new to this topic just like i recived help when i joined academy
